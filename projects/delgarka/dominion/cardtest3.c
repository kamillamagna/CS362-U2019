/* Basic requirements of endTurn():
* Played Action and Treasure cards should be placed in discard pile
* Player should discard remaining cards from hand
* Player should draw five cards for their next hand
* NumActions and numBuys should be reset to 1
* outpostPlayed, phase, and playedCardCount should be reset to 0
* coins should be reset to 3
* Play should pass to the next player in line
